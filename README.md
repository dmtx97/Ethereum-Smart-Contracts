# Ethereum Smart Contracts

Script searches for contracts within Etherscan.io with modern version and downloads them. I was unable to find a utility that does this for me so I made one myself. 

All of the smart contracts are found in the output folder. This does not account for contracts that have multiple inheritance this is simply made for analysis with existing contracts in the Ethereum Blockchain.
